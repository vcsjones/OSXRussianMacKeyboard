BootCamp Russian Keyboard Layout
===

This is a .keylayout file that mimics the Russian keyboard layout from Windows while running BootCamp. A common problem faced from others when switching from Windows on BootCamp to OSX is the missing ё letter, which is normally below the escape key.

This keyboard layout restores the ё character to under the escape key. On Windows BootCamp Russian Keyboard, the [ and ] characters are missing, which this matches.

Installing
===

Installing is fairly trivial. Download the .keylayout and .icns file, and copy them into ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts.

Logout and Login from OSX, and this Keyboard layout will be available as "Russian - PC BootCamp" in the Language Input options.
